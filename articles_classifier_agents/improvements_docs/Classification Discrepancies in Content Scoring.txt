Classification Discrepancies in Content Scoring


Example 1: Score 4 vs. Score 5 Analysis for news-bot articles.


Based on the article from the news-bot-layer-2 channel on Slack, I have identified a discrepancy between my classification and ChatGPT's when assigning a score to the content. ChatGPT rated it as a score of 4, while I have assigned it a score of 5 for the following reasons:


* A score 4 is usually factually correct but lacks detailed exploration, only scratches the surface of the topic but context or depth is minimal. However, the analyzed article, while still somewhat superficial, it does provide additional context and connects better with the main topic.
* The analyzed content, unlike content belonging to the score 4, a score 5 content flows better, making it easier to follow without being extensive.
* For a score 4, typically no innovative ideas or critical thinking is presented. However, in this article analyzed, it has introduced some perspectives and simple reflection that enhanced understanding, even if not particularly innovative.
* Clarity but lack of engagement.
* On score 4, there are relevant metrics that are shared, however, there is no deeper explanation of what implications they might have on the ecosystem. Based on the article analyzed, there are some explanations in relation to what implications they might have on the ecosystem, for example, there is explanation on the large movements on the substantial transactions that polygon experienced with large holders of the token MATIC, moving significant sums of the token.
* Typically on a score 4, the content is limited to only summarizing or listing information, with no further insight into how or why it matters. However, on the article analyzed, the information is clearly not only listing information, but it also goes into a little more detail than a simple listing regarding the Whale Movements Signal and the potential changes, technical Indicators, the on-chain data, etc. Giving some context why it matters and some slight explanation of what they mean and some subtle implications. Albeit in a still superficial way but it does so, something that score 4 has yet to achieve.
* The article basically maintained the factual accuracy and clarity of the score 4 but with the already improvements mentioned. Adding a small degree of depth and relevance to the basic structure of score 4, without reaching a comprehensive analysis level that a score 6 will be achieving.


ChatGPT’s Classification Summary
* Score Assigned: 4 (Moderate Quality / Basic or Superficial Information)
* Justification: Factually accurate but lacks deep exploration and relies on summary without critical insights.
Classification Explanation
The article falls into Score 4 due to its factual accuracy and moderate overview of whale activities and technical indicators surrounding MATIC. The information is reliable but lacks depth, innovative insights, or technical analysis that would elevate it to higher quality. The piece merely summarizes basic indicators and on-chain data without breaking down complex technicalities or providing a critical analysis of their implications.
Justification Against Lower Scores
* The content does not contain misleading or speculative information. It avoids exaggerated or alarmist tones, providing factual summaries rather than sensational or speculative statements, which excludes it from Score 1-3.
Justification Against Higher Scores
* For a higher score, such as 6 or 7, the article would need to include deeper technical analysis, explore the long-term impact of whale activity and indicators, and provide structured analysis with more critical perspectives. The superficial summary style and lack of innovative insights keep it within the basic information range (Score 4).


Example 2: Score 4 vs. Score 5 Analysis for news-bot articles.


Based on another article from the news-bot-layer-2 channel on Slack, this is the other discrepancy I have identified between my classification and ChatGPT's. ChatGPT rated this article, as a score of 5, while from my perspective, according to the rules, it falls into score 4 for the following reasons:


A score 5 would maintain the factual accuracy and clarity of score 4 but with the following improvements: 


* While still somewhat superficial, it provides additional context and connects better with the main topic. However, the article analyzed, is factually correct but lacks detailed exploration, only scratches the surface of the topic but context or depth is minimal.
* Score 5 introduces some additional perspectives or simple reflections that enhance understanding, even if not particularly innovative. In this regard, the article does not introduce innovative ideas or critical thinking.
* Score 5 contents are more structured and flow better, making it easier to follow without being extensive. The analyzed content is a short one, not extensive, however, it lacks a fully clear structure as the article begins with a headline and introduction, but it could be clearer about the main points right away. A structured introduction summarizing key points such as Coinbase’s addition of POL, the transition from MATIC, and Polygon’s roadmap could improve clarity. There is also a lack of define sections which makes it harder to navigate. And lastly, the sequence of information is somewhat disjointed. For example, the article introduces the rebranding, then shifts to details on community decisions, and then moves back to Coinbase’s listing information. A more chronological or thematic approach would provide a clearer flow.
* On score 5, technical details are slightly expanded, and there’s some basic explanation of how certain technologies or protocols function. In this analyzed article, there are not technical aspects that are expanded. The article focuses primarily on the logistics and procedural details of the POL token's upcoming launch, rebrand, and listing on Coinbase. It briefly mentions POL’s role in future Polygon functionality (like staking, gas fees, and participation in Data Availability Committees), but it does not explain how these technologies or processes work. Instead, the article assumes a reader's familiarity with these concepts and provides only surface-level information on the token's transition without going deeper into the technical mechanics or the functioning of Polygon's technology stack.
* On score 5 contents, instead of just listing or summarizing information, it briefly explains why certain aspects matter, giving it more practical significance. In this analyzed article, the content is limited to summarizing the information, with no further insight into how or why it matters.


This article has more features of a score 4, it definitely has clarity but lack of engagement for the already mentioned reasons above.
ChatGPT’s Classification Summary
* Score Assigned: 5 (Moderate Quality / Basic or Superficial Information)
* Justification: 
   * Provides clear, factual information on POL’s listing and transition details.
   * Lacks in-depth analysis or technical exploration, making it more of a straightforward update than an analytical piece.
Classification Explanation
* Accurate and Informative: The article provides factual information about the upcoming POL token and its listing on Coinbase’s roadmap, as well as the broader context of Polygon’s rebranding from MATIC to POL. It explains the purpose of the rebrand, upcoming changes, and future plans for POL's utility, offering readers basic yet accurate insights.
* Lacks Depth and Technical Analysis: While the article includes relevant information about the rebranding process and its initial utility, it lacks deeper technical exploration of how the transition to POL will impact Polygon's technical landscape or broader ecosystem. It is mostly a straightforward summary without critical analysis or in-depth insights.
Justification for Score
* Why Not Score 4: The article goes beyond a surface-level summary by providing contextual details on the transition and quoting statements from developers, making it more comprehensive than basic content rated as Score 4.
* Why Not Score 6: Although informative, the article does not delve into technical specifics or provide a substantial analysis of POL’s strategic impact on Polygon's ecosystem. It lacks the depth of analysis required for a higher score.


Summary of Adjacent Differences in ChatGPT vs. Human Ratings
Example 1: Score 4 (ChatGPT) vs. Score 5 (Belen)
* Interpretation of Depth: ChatGPT often interprets articles as Score 4 if they primarily summarize information without introducing substantial context or depth. In this case, ChatGPT viewed the article as basic and factual without critical insights, typical of Score 4. However, I have considered the article a Score 5 because it introduced slight reflections on whale movements and technical indicators, giving it a bit more depth than a straightforward summary (a very typical approach on score 4 contents).
* Engagement and Structure: ChatGPT tends to classify articles as Score 4 if they are clear but lack engaging or well-structured content. I have rated this as Score 5 due to its better flow and engagement, as well as its slight expansion on relevant points, which added context even if not highly analytical.
* Interpretation of “Insight”: ChatGPT sees Score 4 content as strictly listing or summarizing data, while Score 5 content would begin to hint at “why it matters.” I have seen the article’s brief explanation of whale movements’ implications as adding relevance, a small but significant difference that justified a Score 5.
Example 2: Score 5 (ChatGPT) vs. Score 4 (Belen)
* Expectation of Basic Explanation: ChatGPT rated this article as Score 5, indicating it provided enough context and additional perspectives to be slightly above basic. However, I have rated it as Score 4, as the article focused on logistical details without introducing even basic explanations of technical concepts (e.g., staking, DACs), which Score 5 would typically include.
* Structure and Organization: ChatGPT’s Score 5 rating reflects an interpretation that the article had sufficient structure and flow for moderate engagement. In this regard, I have disagreed, noting that the article’s disjointed organization and lack of a clear introduction or thematic flow limited it to Score 4. This difference in expectation around structure and coherence is a recurring adjacent difference.
* Practical Relevance vs. Procedural Listing: ChatGPT rated this article as Score 5 partly due to its coverage of POL’s role and roadmap, assuming this provided enough context to be practically relevant. I have rated it as Score 4, seeing it as merely procedural information without further insight into why the details matter.
Key Adjacent Differences Between ChatGPT and Human’s rating according to the available set of rules.
1. Depth and Context: ChatGPT may assign a lower score if it perceives content as merely summarizing, while the individual who is in charge of rating the content according to the set rules, may see added reflections or contextual clues as warranting a higher score.
2. Basic Explanation of Technical Terms: ChatGPT considers moderate-quality content (Score 5) to include a basic summary, while the individual in charge may rate content lower if explanations of technologies, metrics or why something matters are absent, keeping it within a more procedural summary.
3. Structure and Flow:
* ChatGPT: May consider content adequately structured for a mid-tier score if it presents information clearly, even if the organization is not ideal.
* Human: Places more emphasis on logical flow and structured presentation. Content with a disjointed or unclear organization is often rated lower, as clarity in sequence and flow is seen as essential for engagement and understanding.
4. Practical Significance vs. Procedural Listing:
* ChatGPT: May assign a higher score if the content includes relevant details, assuming this provides practical significance, even without extensive exploration of why the details matter.
* Human: More critical of content that lists or summarizes procedural information without discussing its implications. Higher scores are reserved for content that goes beyond listing facts to explain why they are important.
5. Engagement and Reader Value:
   * ChatGPT: Considers factual accuracy and moderate detail sufficient for middle-range scores, often viewing straightforward summaries as meeting the criteria for moderate engagement.
   * Human: Values engagement and depth, assigning higher scores to content that brings added insights or reflections that enhance reader value, rather than just summarizing.
Summary of Adjacent Differences
* ChatGPT's scoring leans towards a focus on factual clarity and relevance at a basic level, while our humanistic ratings emphasize the added value of context, technical explanations, and well-structured presentation.
* From the humanistic point of view and according to the established rules, the highest points in this case of comparison (score 4 and score 5) are reserved for content that moves beyond procedural detail to include implications, practical insights, or a coherent flow.
