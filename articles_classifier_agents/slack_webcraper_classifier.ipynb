    "### 1. Imports and Model Initialization:\n",
    "- Sets up the latest GPT-4 model as the base language model\n",
    "- Includes commented alternatives for other LLMs (Claude, Mixtral, Gemini, etc.)\n",
    "### 2. Message Trimming Setup:\n",
    "- Handles long conversations by trimming messages to fit within token limits\n",
    "- Keeps the most recent messages when context gets too long\n",
    "### 3. Agent Node Function:\n",
    "- Creates a standardized way for agents to process and return messages\n",
    "- Maintains conversation state between different agents\n",
    "### 4. Team Supervisor Creation:\n",
    "- Creates a routing agent that decides which team member should act next\n",
    "- Uses a function-calling approach to make routing decisions\n",
    "-Can choose between team members or decide to finish the conversation\n",
    "### 5. Tools Definition:\n",
    "- Defines financial analysis tools available to the agents\n",
    "- These tools can fetch various types of financial data and company information\n"

This type of content often contains outright inaccuracies, completely unverified claims, or fabricated data. It is typically sensationalist in nature and may be designed purely to attract clicks, with little regard for the accuracy or integrity of the information.\n",

Content rated as a Score 2 is typically misleading, speculative, or incomplete. It often includes some elements of truth, but these are either exaggerated, taken out of context, or mixed with speculative or unverified claims that distort the overall message. While it might contain fragments of accurate information, these are overshadowed by a lack of evidence, poor reasoning, or unsubstantiated accusations.

The information might be based on assumptions or incomplete analysis, and often serves as clickbait rather than delivering meaningful insights. These materials generally do not contribute to a reader's deeper understanding of the topic and may contain incorrect or misleading interpretations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Description: Content provides correct and reliable information but tends to remain superficial or basic. While the information may be factually accurate and sourced from reliable places, it lacks depth, critical analysis, and innovative insights. While score 4 provides correct and reliable information, it can include some speculative scenarios, but less than score 3. This kind of content offers a surface-level understanding of a topic but lacks deep exploration or original thought.\n",

    "\n",
    "Factually correct but lacks detailed exploration, only scratches the surface of the topic but context or depth is minimal.\n",
    "No innovative ideas or critical thinking is presented.\n",
    "Clarity but lack of engagement.\n",
    "There is little exploration of technical details. There are also mentions of technology but without analyzing it.

    "A score 5 would maintain the factual accuracy and clarity of score 4 but with the following improvements: \n",
    "\n",
    "More context: While still somewhat superficial, it provides additional context and connects better with the main topic.\n",
    "Basic development of Ideas: Introduces some additional perspectives or simple reflections that enhance understanding, even if not particularly innovative.\n",
    "Improved organization: Content is more structured and flows better, making it easier to follow without being extensive.\n",
    "Slight expansion of technical details: Technical details are slightly expanded, and there's some basic explanation of how certain technologies or protocols function.\n",
    "Added relevance: Instead of just listing information, it briefly explains why certain aspects matter, giving it more practical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A score 5 adds a small degree of depth and relevance to the basic structure of score 4, without reaching a comprehensive analysis level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 6-7: Good Quality / Proper Analysis but no Innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Content within the 6-7 score range is considered solid and reliable, providing accurate and relevant information, but lacks the depth and innovation that would make it highly impactful. It offers a clear understanding of key concepts and data, usually supported by reputable sources, but stops short of offering new insights or advanced analysis. This type of content is useful and informative, but it mainly serves to present known information without breaking new ground.\n",

    "Criteria for a score 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate and well-sourced: Includes solid sources and factual accuracy throughout, with references that support the core arguments.\n",
    "Technical detail is explored but not fully developed (basic to moderate technical detail).\n",
    "Well-organized with appropriate visuals (charts, diagrams) without diving deeply into technical complexities. It also lacks innovative structure and new depth.\n",
    "Limited Innovation: The content is informative but doesn't introduce new ideas. It recaps existing data, like comparing networks by transaction volumes, without deeper technical insights.\n",
    "Offers a practical overview and is relevant for a quick summary, but lacks depth and long-term impact.\n",
    "Contextually relevant: mentions real-world implications without pushing new boundaries and analysing them.\n",
    "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Score: 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Comprehensive Breakdown of Complex Issues**: The article presents a detailed technical analysis of Ethereum's potential for a bullish market in December, breaking down complex topics into understandable components. This aligns with the score 8 criteria of offering detailed technical analysis with clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Solid Research Foundation**: It leverages multiple data points, such as ETF inflows, technical patterns, Open Interest, and Exchange Reserves, citing them to support the bullish outlook. This demonstrates a reliance on reputable sources, enhancing the article's credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Nuanced Discussion**: The analysis explores technical nuances, addressing key indicators that suggest a bullish market, which satisfies the requirement for nuanced discussion within the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clear Structure and Readability**: The article is well-organized, making it easy for readers to follow the argument for a bullish December for Ethereum, even when dealing with complex ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Relevant and Actionable Insights**: It provides actionable insights based on the analysis, which adds value to the subject matter for readers interested in cryptocurrency investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Innovation and Fresh Perspectives**: While the article introduces new viewpoints by analyzing recent market trends and data, it may not necessarily present groundbreaking methodologies. However, it still impacts its context by offering fresh perspectives on Ethereum's market potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Not Lower:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The article does not fall into the lower score categories (6-7) because it surpasses merely presenting known information without breaking new ground. It provides a deep dive into Ethereum's potential for a bullish December with a solid foundation of evidence and a well-structured analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Not Higher:\n",
      "\n",
      "- To qualify for a score of 9, the article would need to provide strategic influence, unique interpretations or models, and a higher level of industry relevance and applicability, impacting market trends or strategic initiatives. While it offers detailed insights and analysis, the article stops short of reshaping decisions within the industry or introducing new, influential methodologies or interpretations that would mark a significant departure from existing knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The article provides a detailed and well-supported analysis of Ethereum's bullish potential in December, backed by solid research and relevant, actionable insights.\n",
      "- It does not reach the transformative influence required for a higher score but offers substantial value in its current form, justifying its classification as an 8/10.\n"

      "\n",
      "Justification for Score 8:\n",
      "- The review of Art Blocks' NFT project demonstrates a high level of technical detail and innovation, especially in making artworks accessible directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach ensures the longevity and sustainability of digital art, aligning well with the criteria for a high-quality technical analysis with clear insights.\n",
      "- The content provides comprehensive breakdowns of complex issues such as decentralization, blockchain technology's role in art preservation, and the technical achievements of Art Blocks. It relies on the project's innovative steps toward making NFT art more sustainable and less dependent on centralized platforms.\n",
      "- The article offers nuanced discussion points on the mission and vision of Art Blocks, its market impact, and the challenges in user experience. These insights add value to the subject, making intricate concepts accessible and relevant to the audience.\n",
      "- While the article is well-organized and presents clear, actionable insights, it falls short of the Score 9 criteria. It does not offer strategic influence or unique interpretations and models that significantly shape decisions within the industry. The focus is more on articulating the project's current achievements and its implications for the NFT space rather than providing a strategic guide or influencing market trends.\n",
      "- The review is exceptionally organized and easy to follow, presenting a logical flow of arguments about the technical and innovative strides made by Art Blocks. However, the content does not introduce new methodologies or groundbreaking ideas that would elevate it to a transformative or foundational document status, which is a requirement for a Score 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not a lower score:\n",
      "- The content goes beyond merely summarizing information or providing basic analysis. It delves into the technical aspects and innovative approaches of Art Blocks, providing clear, insightful analysis supported by solid research. This distinguishes the review from content that would typically score between 6 to 7, which may offer good quality analysis but lacks the depth or innovation presented here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not a higher score:\n",
      "- While the content is of high quality, offering detailed technical insights and clear industry relevance, it does not meet all criteria for a Score 9. It lacks the strategic influence and unique interpretations that could significantly impact market trends or strategic initiatives within the NFT and broader blockchain industry. The article is informative and impactful but does not reach the level of advanced technical analysis with strategic impact defined for a Score 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "- The review of Art Blocks' project provides an in-depth technical analysis and presents clear insights into the project's innovation in the NFT space.\n",
      "- Despite its strengths, the article does not provide the strategic influence or groundbreaking methodologies required for a higher score, justifying its classification as Score 8.\n"

      "\n",
      "Score: **5**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Relevance and Clarity:** The article's focus on adjusting withdrawal fees for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by Coinone indicates its relevance to the cryptocurrency community, especially for users and investors engaged with this exchange. The detailed mention of specific fee adjustments suggests clarity and specificity, which is valuable for readers seeking current information on exchange policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Accuracy:** Given the detailed figures provided (e.g., adjustments from 0.0015BTC to 0.0008BTC for Bitcoin and from 0.02ETH to 0.005ETH for Ethereum), the article appears to offer accurate and concrete information, assuming these figures are correct and verifiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insightfulness:** While the article provides specific data on fee adjustments and mentions the reason behind these changes (increase in the price of virtual assets), it may lack broader analysis or critical insight into the implications of these adjustments beyond the immediate effects on transaction costs. This suggests a moderate level of depth in the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Not a Lower Score:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The article does not appear to be misleading, speculative, or lacking in credible information, which would be necessary for a score below 4. The specificity of the information provided and its direct relevance to the cryptocurrency market operations suggest a level of quality above the very low-quality or speculative content that would warrant a score of 3 or below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Not a Higher Score:\n",
      "\n",
      "- While the article is informative, the extracted details do not indicate that it provides advanced technical analysis, innovative insights, or strategic implications that would justify a score in the range of 6-9. The content seems to focus on reporting specific changes rather than offering deep analysis or novel perspectives that could significantly influence readers' understanding or decision-making in the cryptocurrency space.\n",

      "### Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Relevant and accurate** information on fee adjustments by Coinone for Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions.\n",
      "- **Moderate depth**, providing specific data and citing reasons for the changes but lacking broader analysis or innovative insights into the implications for the market or the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.\n"

Therefore, I will reassess the content as a whole according to the provided classification criteria.\n",

      "1. **Accurate and Well-Sourced Information**: The document appears to provide accurate information on Algorand, Ethereum, and Lunex, discussing their staking rewards, technological features, and market performance. This suggests that the content is based on solid sources and factual accuracy, a key criterion for a score in the 6-7 range.\n",

However, there's no indication that the document explores these technologies with the depth or advanced analysis required for higher scores.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Limited Innovation**: While the document provides valuable insights into staking coins for a bull run, there's no indication that it introduces new methodologies or groundbreaking ideas. It recaps existing data and potential, aligning with the criteria for a score of 6 to 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Practical Overview Without Deep Analysis**: The document provides a practical overview of the staking coins but appears to lack the depth, long-term impact analysis, and innovative thought that would elevate it to the 8-9 range.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The document is classified as score 6-7, reflecting its solid, reliable information and proper analysis of cryptocurrency staking options. It is informative and useful for readers looking for staking opportunities but does not break new ground in terms of technical analysis or innovative insights.\n",
      "- It does not qualify for a lower score because it provides accurate, well-sourced information with a moderate level of technical detail. It doesn't fall into speculative or misleading information categories that would warrant a score of 3 or below.\n",
